# Home-Detector

This script will check if a device is connected to your FritzBox 
and turn your sonoff-devices off or on based on time or present of your device.

## Configuration

Create a copy of `sample.config.yaml` with the name `config.yaml` and add your
values to it.

## Additional note

This is highly WIP.
